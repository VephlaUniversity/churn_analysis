Post-Analysis Insights

Osun and Abuja emerge as key markets, while the 21–40 age group drives churn. Despite high usage, Mobile SIM Cards face loyalty challenges, and the 1.5TB Yearly Plan proves a revenue powerhouse. The March revenue dip warrants further investigation, and the gender disparity in churn suggests targeted interventions.

Recommendations

Re-engage 21–40 Age Group: Launch tailored campaigns using preferred devices and plans to win back this high-churn demographic.
Promote 5G Routers: Market 5G broadband routers as stable, long-term options in home or business bundles, leveraging their higher loyalty rates.
Address Call Tariffs: Offer free weekend or off-peak calls to address the 54 tariff-related churns.
Analyze March Dip: Replicate February’s successful strategies to recover the March revenue drop.
Women-Focused Offers: Develop bundles for students, working moms, or professionals, given the 150 female churns.
Expand to Mid-Adoption States: Target Anambra, Enugu, or Delta with regional campaigns, building on strength in Osun and Abuja.
Retain High Spenders: Offer upgrades or bonuses to loyal, high-data users who rarely churn.
Policy Makers: Consider subsidies for high-churn devices like Mobile SIM Cards.
Marketing Teams: Focus campaigns on Osun and high-distribution states.
Customer Service: Provide support programs for the 41–50 age group.
Conclusion

The Q1 2025 report positions Osun and the 41–50 age group as focal points for churn reduction, with the 1.5TB Yearly Plan leading revenue. While device and plan insights are robust, deeper data on gender, churn reasons, and state-specific trends are needed for a holistic strategy.
